    "What is the typical time frame you consider when looking at an investment opportunity?",
  secondAboutPageAccordionText:
    "Usually, one to three years. Having said that, we do evaluate each company monthly to consider whether the current position size is the most effective use of capital. Certainly, there are times when we are very excited about an investment and take a significant position only to watch the rest of the world recognize the attractiveness of the investment and drive up the share price, which of course lowers the prospective return. Different firms handle this situation in different ways, but at Atlantic Partners, if we have developed that longer-term confidence in a business and a management team, we will typically maintain a position—though perhaps not of the same size.",
