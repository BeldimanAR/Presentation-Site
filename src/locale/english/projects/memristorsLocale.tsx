    "This Memristor Technology is presented by CYBERSWARM and is developed in partnerships with top research institutes from Romania.{br} {br}Memristors are interesting for: {br} • Security applications based on PUF (Physically Unclonable Functions) {br} • Neuromorphic computers (computers working similar with human brain) {br} • Pattern recognition",

  infoMemristorsText2:
    "{br} Memristors & Next steps {br} • Memristors R&D continuation; Further technology development; IP position further strengthening; Realization of large memristors arrays and crossbars. { br}• Specific applications development with selected customers/partners: {br}• Security applications based on PUF (physically unclonable functions) {br} • Neuromorphic applications: {br} - Short term: small hardware based neural networks able to detect application specific patterns; {br} weights calculated externally will be mapped on the memristor arrays and crossbars employing our developed improved accuracy programming method; suitable for edge computing, IoT devices, industrial robots, etc where low energy consumption, low computing power and no cloud connectivity are required. {br} - Mid term: a new building block of the next-gen artificial brain, which could drastically boost the benefits/advantages of AI implemented hardware problem-solving solutions. {br} - Long term: complex neuromorphic chip having also the ability to learn. {br } - Very long term: Asimov’s robot R.
